👋 Hello there! I'm Abhishek aka Avio, a passionate Full Stack developer with expertise in MERN/MEAN app development and AWS.

💻 As a Full Stack developer, I specialize in building robust and scalable applications using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) or MEAN (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, Node.js) stacks. I thrive on the challenges of creating seamless user experiences and crafting efficient back-end solutions.

☁️ Additionally, I have a strong background in AWS (Amazon Web Services) and enjoy leveraging its cloud services to deploy and manage applications. From EC2 and S3 to Lambda and DynamoDB, I'm well-versed in using AWS tools to build highly available and scalable infrastructures.

📊 Project management is a passion of mine, and I excel at coordinating tasks, leading development teams, and delivering projects on time and within budget. I embrace Agile methodologies and believe in fostering effective collaboration to achieve success.

🌟 What truly drives me is the opportunity to create elegant and practical solutions to real-world problems. I'm always eager to learn new technologies and stay up-to-date with the latest industry trends, especially in the realms of MERN/MEAN app development and AWS.

🔧 When it comes to version control and collaboration, Git and GitHub are my go-to tools. I'm an advocate for open-source software and actively contribute to the developer community.

🎯 In my free time, you'll find me exploring new coding techniques, experimenting with side projects, or immersing myself in the vibrant tech community through meetups and conferences.
