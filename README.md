ðŸ‘‹ Hello there! I'm Abhishek aka Avio, a passionate Full Stack developer with a strong love for project management and coding.

ðŸ’» As a Full Stack developer, I have experience working with a wide range of technologies and frameworks. From front-end development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, to back-end development with Node.js, Python, and PHP, I enjoy the challenge of building robust and scalable applications.

ðŸ“Š Additionally, I have a keen interest in project management and strive to ensure smooth and efficient workflows. I am well-versed in Agile methodologies and have experience leading development teams, coordinating tasks, and delivering projects on time and within budget.

ðŸŒŸ What truly drives me is the opportunity to create elegant and practical solutions to real-world problems. I am always eager to learn new technologies and stay up-to-date with the latest industry trends.

ðŸ”§ When it comes to version control and collaboration, Git and GitHub are my go-to tools. I believe in the power of open-source software and enjoy contributing to the developer community whenever I can.

ðŸŽ¯ In my free time, you'll find me exploring new coding techniques, experimenting with side projects, or immersing myself in the vibrant tech community through meetups and conferences.
